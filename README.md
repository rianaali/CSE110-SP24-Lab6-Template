1)The automated tests should fit “Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed”.
This allows for continuous integration and to encourage testing very often throughout development, not just at the end. It also automates the feedback efficiently for developers so they don’t have to manually run tests locally every single time someone wants to push a change. Every team member can also see the results on GitHub. 
2) No, end to end testing would not be used to returning the correct output of a function.
